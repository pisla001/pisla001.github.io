        <div id="main">
        <p><span id="priya"><img src="islam.jpg" alt"priya"></span>I have always been indecisive about what I want to do with my life. The most commonly asked question I get,is "Priya what do you want to do with your life?", and my answer was always "I don't really know, but the moment I find out, I'll get back to you". Well I finally was able to get back to everyone with the help my Public Relations proffesors at <a href="https://www.plattsburgh.edu/"> SUNY Plattsburgh<a href="http://www.plattsburgh.edu/"></a>. I have always worked exceptionally well with others, and have known from a young age that I wanted to work in a creative environment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p> I attend SUNY Plattsburgh as a senior, majoring in Public Relations, with a minor in Radio. I have interned at a law firm in the Manhattan over the summer, in the Center for Canadian Studies as a secretary, and at various retail shops over my summer breaks.</p>
        
        <p> I also bring to the table strong computer proficiencies in MS Word, MS Excel, and currently possess two certifications for my Public Relations minor. The first is the Human Subject Certification, and the Hootsuite Academy Certification. </p>
